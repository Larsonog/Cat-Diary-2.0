# Cat Diary 
Do you have a cat? Do they do silly things that you want to record so you never forget? Well I too have a cat and let me tell you she is the silliest cat around. I created this app as a way to quickly jot down the silly moments and things that your cat does so you never forget. 
This is an app for anyone and everyone. While it's useful if you have a cat, this app can still be used even if you have a dog or a guinea pig or any other pet. You'll have to get passed the excessive cat imagery and references. 
In this app you can enter whatever you want to record into a text field and hit "meow" to save. You also have the option to rate how good the vibes of that memory was. You can also edit pet vibes outside of the text box if you don't feel like recording a memory. This is a great way to keep track of how silly your pet is being over time!
I love the idea of this app because it's essentially everything I could ever want.
